The Trump Presidency was appalling; the world watched in slack-jawed awe four years ago as the most crass, arrogant, and ignorant person conceivable was elected president. From the outside it must have looked like the behavior of a self-destructive narcissist; from the inside it felt like a betrayal and a gut punch. Electing him once was a hair-brained misstep, electing him a second time would have been an unforgivably deliberate act of willful malice. And for a second there, whoooo boy I really thought we were going to elect him a second time. For a second, I really got scared that my country was not just broken, but beyond fixing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For as long as I&#8217;ve lived, I&#8217;ve believed that America was broken but very much worth fixing. And I wasn&#8217;t ready to lose that. I wasn&#8217;t ready to lose all faith in my beautiful, fucked up country. And thank God I didn&#8217;t have to, because my beautiful, fucked up country came through  and did the right thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s all I have to say for now. It&#8217;s been a few days but I still cry when I think about it. Tears of deep, deep gratitude. </p>\n","slug":"america-restores-its-dignity","categories":[{"name":"Uncategorized"}]}},{"node":{"id":"b13acf6a-2e71-5e5c-93cc-eebefe6a9b20","excerpt":"<p>He was an author, philosopher, NYU Professor, and general gangster who had the voice of a 40 year old man despite being 90.</p>\n","date":"Thursday Nov 5th, 2020 03:37pm","title":"RIP James Carse","content":"\n<p>He was an author, philosopher, NYU Professor, and general gangster who had the voice of a 40 year old man despite being 90. He wrote a book called Finite and Infinite Game which will blow my mind, once I finally finish it and give it the focus it deserves. I&#8217;ll write a review of it sometime later and try to do it justice, for I have no hope of doing it justice here and now. This post is just to say that JC was a brilliant and deeply original thinker (and maybe also to test the post-rendering order on my site.) Anyway, rest in peace beautiful man. </p>\n","slug":"rip-james-carse","categories":[{"name":"Uncategorized"}]}},{"node":{"id":"c44b4fd2-57da-596d-a61a-62aa33a6da14","excerpt":"<p>Yep!

It happened yesterday in the early afternoon. I got a call from my boss who told me in a very honest and professional tone that he and his partner were having issues, that the business was going to need restructuring, and that he couldn&#8217;t justify keeping me on the payroll while there were fundamental questions about if and how the business would move forward. I told him I understand completely. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler, if you&#8217;re reading this, it&#8217;s been a real pleasure working with you dude. You made me the third team member of your business, which was and continues to be your baby; you made room for me when funding was slim and you didn&#8217;t have to. You know this, but I ain&#8217;t got nothing but love for Moximetrics. Thanks homie. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back to the general reader. That&#8217;s really it. It was only a part time job, but it was fun and I liked it. Alas I am now back on the job search. Kind of serendipitous that it happened in the middle of this 10-day portfolio challenge I&#8217;ve given myself though&#8230; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, I&#8217;m not tripping; I&#8217;m okay and I know I&#8217;ll be okay.  Just gotta get back to work, whatever that means. Right now it means finishing this motherfucking portfolio page ðŸ™‚</p>\n","slug":"i-just-lost-my-job","categories":[{"name":"Uncategorized"}]}},{"node":{"id":"e63d5be3-80d6-5b8c-b6cb-699fc13c4376","excerpt":"<p>Well, that&#8217;s not entirely true.
