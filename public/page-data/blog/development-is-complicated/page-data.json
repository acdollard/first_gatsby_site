Or I should say <em>the deeper the work, the clearer my head becomes. </em>That would be lovely because it would indicate that the way to find that clear-head isn&#8217;t so mysterious, and that a clear-head is not requisite, but rather a consequence, of doing challenging work. Which, so far, for me, this definitely is. </p>\n","slug":"development-is-complicated","categories":[{"name":"Uncategorized"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
