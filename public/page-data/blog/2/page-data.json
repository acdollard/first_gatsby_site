At least, we think it is. And don&#8217;t get me wrong, busting one&#8217;s ass is sometimes necessary and completely unavoidable if you want to do anything worthwhile, whether it&#8217;s building a company, paying your bills, or raising your kids. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve started to wonder about all the times when <em>hard work</em> was, well, unnecessary. Or at least inefficient. And I&#8217;ve started to believe that&#8217;s the case a lot more often than we think. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I once wrote an if-else statement that was like 25 lines of code. (this was during my first two months of bootcamp, mind you) and it took forever. All the typing, copy/pasting, and carefully organizing my data ended up delivering me the result I was hoping for (the app worked!) but it was horribly, embarrassingly, inefficient. I could have done the same thing with about 4 line of code instead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also love tracking the hours I spend working on coding as a measure of how productive I&#8217;m being, or how &#8220;hard&#8221; I&#8217;m working. But if I had written that if-statement the efficient way, those hours I was so proud of logging simply wouldn&#8217;t have been logged. Does that mean I would&#8217;ve been a less hard worker? Well, yes. But it also means, in that case, I would have been a better coder. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, my thought for now is, there&#8217;s an important caveat to hard work that I think we should talk about more. It&#8217;s that it doesn&#8217;t mean much if the work is being done inefficiently. <em>Work smart, not hard </em>sums it up nicely. I made that up, by the way.</p>\n","slug":"more-work-less-energy","categories":[{"name":"Uncategorized"}]}},{"node":{"id":"9c962a8f-dd28-55a8-88ab-3e11118183cc","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;m writing this as a sample blog post for my personal site.

Turns out I wasn&#8217;t today, but as I got deeper and deeper into the work <em>my head cleared itself. </em>Huh. Or I should say <em>the deeper the work, the clearer my head becomes. </em>That would be lovely because it would indicate that the way to find that clear-head isn&#8217;t so mysterious, and that a clear-head is not requisite, but rather a consequence, of doing challenging work. Which, so far, for me, this definitely is. </p>\n","slug":"development-is-complicated","categories":[{"name":"Uncategorized"}]}}],"numberOfPages":2,"currentPage":2}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
