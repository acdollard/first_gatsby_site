He wrote a book called Finite and Infinite Game which will blow my mind, once I finally finish it and give it the focus it deserves. I&#8217;ll write a review of it sometime later and try to do it justice, for I have no hope of doing it justice here and now. This post is just to say that JC was a brilliant and deeply original thinker (and maybe also to test the post-rendering order on my site.) Anyway, rest in peace beautiful man. </p>\n","slug":"rip-james-carse"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
