The Trump Presidency was appalling; the world watched in slack-jawed awe four years ago as the most crass, arrogant, and ignorant person conceivable was elected president. From the outside it must have looked like the behavior of a self-destructive narcissist; from the inside it felt like a betrayal and a gut punch. Electing him once was a hair-brained misstep, electing him a second time would have been an unforgivably deliberate act of willful malice. And for a second there, whoooo boy I really thought we were going to elect him a second time. For a second, I really got scared that my country was not just broken, but beyond fixing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For as long as I&#8217;ve lived, I&#8217;ve believed that America was broken but very much worth fixing. And I wasn&#8217;t ready to lose that. I wasn&#8217;t ready to lose all faith in my beautiful, fucked up country. And thank God I didn&#8217;t have to, because my beautiful, fucked up country came through  and did the right thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s all I have to say for now. It&#8217;s been a few days but I still cry when I think about it. Tears of deep, deep gratitude. </p>\n","slug":"america-restores-its-dignity"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
