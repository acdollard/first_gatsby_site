It is rather embarrassing especially since I announced publicly that it would be ready over a week ago; not to mention my own competence as a developer is being seriously called into question, since it shouldn&#8217;t be the most complicated site in the world and in fact a lot of the tools I&#8217;m using like Netlify, Google Domains, and Gatsby, are designed to be easy to use. Well NOT FOR ME THEY&#8217;RE NOT! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However. There are some positive things I can say. For example, I would say that my understanding of how the DNS works has increased by about 1000% in the last four days, just from struggling to configure my site&#8217;s URL. What&#8217;s a domain vs a sub-domain? How do I register one? What&#8217;s the difference between an A-record and a CNAME? What are name servers? Why, when I change my name servers does my wordpress subdomain A record suddenly stop working? All questions posed, and answered, on my digital quest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m learning a ton. Good. But another, maybe more important thing I noticed is that for the first time in a long time, I can really honestly say I&#8217;ve tried my hardest. Even though progress has been slow and mostly invisible, for once, there&#8217;s no critical voice in the back of my head lamenting that I didn&#8217;t really find out what I was made of. Well, I got to find out this time, and turns out I&#8217;m made of something better than shit but significantly worse than something you&#8217;d want to eat. And, surprisingly, knowing that didn&#8217;t hurt as bad as all the other times when that critical lamenting voice had a point. </p>\n","slug":"sucking-hurts-worse-than-waiting"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
