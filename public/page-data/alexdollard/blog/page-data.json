To say nothing of his performance as a President. This dude, who would destroy the environment, gut social welfare programs, who disregards science, doesn&#8217;t pay taxes except to China, who won&#8217;t read the reports his staff members give him, who needs to hear his own name to stay focused, who apparently has no moral code whatsoever and who just <em>says shit </em>that has no basis in reality&#8230; this dude doesn&#8217;t even want to be president anymore in my opinion and <em>yet </em>there are still people who support him. This morning I learned that a friend of a friend, a young person from a nice family, voted for Trump. His reason? Biden&#8217;s tax plan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That might make sense to me if Trump had put forward a tax plan of his own, or any kind of plan for that matter. (by the way it&#8217;s 3 days after election day as I write and the results still aren&#8217;t in so we&#8217;re all kind of on edge here) But there is no Trump plan. For anything. Taxes, Covid, Climate, you name it. No plan at all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is apparently preferable to some people over &#8220;a plan.&#8221; I put a plan in quotes because I don&#8217;t know how else to emphasize what a basic fucking minimum I&#8217;m talking about here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Trump&#8217;s supporters are able to write off the fact that he doesn&#8217;t have any plans. They&#8217;re able to dismiss all the crazy shit that comes out of his mouth as &#8216;locker room talk&#8217; or that he&#8217;s just misconstrued by the media. (If you can write down what he said on paper and it &#8220;sounds bad&#8221;, is that the media&#8217;s fault?) They can dismiss him ignoring the pleas of climate experts as California burns. They can even dismiss him cozying up to white supremacists and Vladimir Putin. All of that, and much more, <em>aren&#8217;t as bad as Biden&#8217;s tax plan.</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two things come to mind: first, go <em>fuck</em> yourself you dumb fucking cunts. God damn I&#8217;m embarrassed to call you my countrymen. I&#8217;m sorry, that was rude but it just came out. And it&#8217;s how I feel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, it&#8217;s clearly not about taxes here. It&#8217;s about something along the lines of &#8220;fuck the left&#8221; or something like that. Or some kind of bizarre notion that BLM is an anti-white movement, or that civil rights are a zero-sum game, or that AOC wants to tax us to death, take our guns, and curb our freedom of speech. (aka maybe the police shouldn&#8217;t murder unarmed black citizens, maybe school shootings are bad, maybe someone should be around to fact-check the president&#8217;s Twitter account.) Somehow addressing any of these problems would step on the toes of the hardworking white Americans who just want to be free to protect the beautiful, untainted purity of their irish/german/polish/english/italian/scottish/french/dutch heritage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh here&#8217;s another rich one: my friend&#8217;s friend, the Trump voter who inspired this whole post, <em>hates </em>socialism. He thinks freeloaders will live like kings off of the government without working. He also hasn&#8217;t had a job since March and lets his parents pay for his apartment, car, health insurance, and cell phone bill. But thinks freeloaders are a big problem. Huh. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t have a conclusion here, I just was angry and wanted to rant. I don&#8217;t know whether to expose Trump supporters to my righteous rage or try and bring compassion to the conversation. Certainly nobody&#8217;s heart was reached by yelling and insults. On the other hand, if talking hasn&#8217;t worked already I don&#8217;t know if it ever will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> I was really hoping the country would sweep Trump out of office swiftly and decisively, and that has not happened. We still might win, but there&#8217;s clearly still a lot, a lot of work to do. </p>\n","slug":"trump-supporters-you-make-no-sense-to-me"}},{"node":{"excerpt":"<p>He was an author, philosopher, NYU Professor, and general gangster who had the voice of a 40 year old man despite being 90.</p>\n","wordpress_id":46,"date":"5th 11 2020 15:37","title":"RIP James Carse","content":"\n<p>He was an author, philosopher, NYU Professor, and general gangster who had the voice of a 40 year old man despite being 90.

And don&#8217;t get me wrong, busting one&#8217;s ass is sometimes necessary and completely unavoidable if you want to do anything worthwhile, whether it&#8217;s building a company, paying your bills, or raising your kids. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve started to wonder about all the times when <em>hard work</em> was, well, unnecessary. Or at least inefficient. And I&#8217;ve started to believe that&#8217;s the case a lot more often than we think. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I once wrote an if-else statement that was like 25 lines of code. (this was during my first two months of bootcamp, mind you) and it took forever. All the typing, copy/pasting, and carefully organizing my data ended up delivering me the result I was hoping for (the app worked!) but it was horribly, embarrassingly, inefficient. I could have done the same thing with about 4 line of code instead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also love tracking the hours I spend working on coding as a measure of how productive I&#8217;m being, or how &#8220;hard&#8221; I&#8217;m working. But if I had written that if-statement the efficient way, those hours I was so proud of logging simply wouldn&#8217;t have been logged. Does that mean I would&#8217;ve been a less hard worker? Well, yes. But it also means, in that case, I would have been a better coder. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, my thought for now is, there&#8217;s an important caveat to hard work that I think we should talk about more. It&#8217;s that it doesn&#8217;t mean much if the work is being done inefficiently. <em>Work smart, not hard </em>sums it up nicely. I made that up, by the way.</p>\n","slug":"more-work-less-energy"}},{"node":{"excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;m writing this as a sample blog post for my personal site.

Turns out I wasn&#8217;t today, but as I got deeper and deeper into the work <em>my head cleared itself. </em>Huh. Or I should say <em>the deeper the work, the clearer my head becomes. </em>That would be lovely because it would indicate that the way to find that clear-head isn&#8217;t so mysterious, and that a clear-head is not requisite, but rather a consequence, of doing challenging work.
