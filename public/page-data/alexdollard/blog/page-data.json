Turns out I wasn&#8217;t today, but as I got deeper and deeper into the work <em>my head cleared itself. </em>Huh. Or I should say <em>the deeper the work, the clearer my head becomes. </em>That would be lovely because it would indicate that the way to find that clear-head isn&#8217;t so mysterious, and that a clear-head is not requisite, but rather a consequence, of doing challenging work. Which, so far, for me, this definitely is. </p>\n","slug":"development-is-complicated"}},{"node":{"id":"b93a3a49-cd7e-5db7-a1ce-612e3a3e4c68","excerpt":"<p>Being a hard worker is a good thing.

At least, we think it is. And don&#8217;t get me wrong, busting one&#8217;s ass is sometimes necessary and completely unavoidable if you want to do anything worthwhile, whether it&#8217;s building a company, paying your bills, or raising your kids. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve started to wonder about all the times when <em>hard work</em> was, well, unnecessary. Or at least inefficient. And I&#8217;ve started to believe that&#8217;s the case a lot more often than we think. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I once wrote an if-else statement that was like 25 lines of code. (this was during my first two months of bootcamp, mind you) and it took forever. All the typing, copy/pasting, and carefully organizing my data ended up delivering me the result I was hoping for (the app worked!) but it was horribly, embarrassingly, inefficient. I could have done the same thing with about 4 line of code instead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also love tracking the hours I spend working on coding as a measure of how productive I&#8217;m being, or how &#8220;hard&#8221; I&#8217;m working. But if I had written that if-statement the efficient way, those hours I was so proud of logging simply wouldn&#8217;t have been logged. Does that mean I would&#8217;ve been a less hard worker? Well, yes. But it also means, in that case, I would have been a better coder. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, my thought for now is, there&#8217;s an important caveat to hard work that I think we should talk about more. It&#8217;s that it doesn&#8217;t mean much if the work is being done inefficiently. <em>Work smart, not hard </em>sums it up nicely. I made that up, by the way.</p>\n","slug":"more-work-less-energy"}},{"node":{"id":"afd6f948-4baa-5a99-a588-4eaad9b14449","excerpt":"<p>Well, that&#8217;s not entirely true.

The Trump Presidency was appalling; the world watched in slack-jawed awe four years ago as the most crass, arrogant, and ignorant person conceivable was elected president. From the outside it must have looked like the behavior of a self-destructive narcissist; from the inside it felt like a betrayal and a gut punch. Electing him once was a hair-brained misstep, electing him a second time would have been an unforgivably deliberate act of willful malice. And for a second there, whoooo boy I really thought we were going to elect him a second time. For a second, I really got scared that my country was not just broken, but beyond fixing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For as long as I&#8217;ve lived, I&#8217;ve believed that America was broken but very much worth fixing. And I wasn&#8217;t ready to lose that. I wasn&#8217;t ready to lose all faith in my beautiful, fucked up country. And thank God I didn&#8217;t have to, because my beautiful, fucked up country came through  and did the right thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s all I have to say for now.

It is rather embarrassing especially since I announced publicly that it would be ready over a week ago; not to mention my own competence as a developer is being seriously called into question, since it shouldn&#8217;t be the most complicated site in the world and in fact a lot of the tools I&#8217;m using like Netlify, Google Domains, and Gatsby, are designed to be easy to use. Well NOT FOR ME THEY&#8217;RE NOT! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However. There are some positive things I can say. For example, I would say that my understanding of how the DNS works has increased by about 1000% in the last four days, just from struggling to configure my site&#8217;s URL. What&#8217;s a domain vs a sub-domain? How do I register one? What&#8217;s the difference between an A-record and a CNAME? What are name servers? Why, when I change my name servers does my wordpress subdomain A record suddenly stop working? All questions posed, and answered, on my digital quest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m learning a ton. Good. But another, maybe more important thing I noticed is that for the first time in a long time, I can really honestly say I&#8217;ve tried my hardest. Even though progress has been slow and mostly invisible, for once, there&#8217;s no critical voice in the back of my head lamenting that I didn&#8217;t really find out what I was made of. Well, I got to find out this time, and turns out I&#8217;m made of something better than shit but significantly worse than something you&#8217;d want to eat. And, surprisingly, knowing that didn&#8217;t hurt as bad as all the other times when that critical lamenting voice had a point. </p>\n","slug":"sucking-hurts-worse-than-waiting"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
