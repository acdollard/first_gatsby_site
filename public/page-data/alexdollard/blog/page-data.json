The Trump Presidency was appalling; the world watched in slack-jawed awe four years ago as the most crass, arrogant, and ignorant person conceivable was elected president. From the outside it must have looked like the behavior of a self-destructive narcissist; from the inside it felt like a betrayal and a gut punch. Electing him once was a hair-brained misstep, electing him a second time would have been an unforgivably deliberate act of willful malice. And for a second there, whoooo boy I really thought we were going to elect him a second time. For a second, I really got scared that my country was not just broken, but beyond fixing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For as long as I&#8217;ve lived, I&#8217;ve believed that America was broken but very much worth fixing. And I wasn&#8217;t ready to lose that. I wasn&#8217;t ready to lose all faith in my beautiful, fucked up country. And thank God I didn&#8217;t have to, because my beautiful, fucked up country came through  and did the right thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s all I have to say for now. It&#8217;s been a few days but I still cry when I think about it. Tears of deep, deep gratitude. </p>\n","slug":"america-restores-its-dignity"}},{"node":{"id":"b13acf6a-2e71-5e5c-93cc-eebefe6a9b20","excerpt":"<p>He was an author, philosopher, NYU Professor, and general gangster who had the voice of a 40 year old man despite being 90.</p>\n","date":"5th 11 2020 15:37","title":"RIP James Carse","content":"\n<p>He was an author, philosopher, NYU Professor, and general gangster who had the voice of a 40 year old man despite being 90. He wrote a book called Finite and Infinite Game which will blow my mind, once I finally finish it and give it the focus it deserves. I&#8217;ll write a review of it sometime later and try to do it justice, for I have no hope of doing it justice here and now. This post is just to say that JC was a brilliant and deeply original thinker (and maybe also to test the post-rendering order on my site.)

I told him I understand completely. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler, if you&#8217;re reading this, it&#8217;s been a real pleasure working with you dude. You made me the third team member of your business, which was and continues to be your baby; you made room for me when funding was slim and you didn&#8217;t have to. You know this, but I ain&#8217;t got nothing but love for Moximetrics. Thanks homie. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back to the general reader. That&#8217;s really it. It was only a part time job, but it was fun and I liked it. Alas I am now back on the job search. Kind of serendipitous that it happened in the middle of this 10-day portfolio challenge I&#8217;ve given myself though&#8230; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, I&#8217;m not tripping; I&#8217;m okay and I know I&#8217;ll be okay.  Just gotta get back to work, whatever that means. Right now it means finishing this motherfucking portfolio page 🙂</p>\n","slug":"i-just-lost-my-job"}},{"node":{"id":"e63d5be3-80d6-5b8c-b6cb-699fc13c4376","excerpt":"<p>Well, that&#8217;s not entirely true.

At least, we think it is. And don&#8217;t get me wrong, busting one&#8217;s ass is sometimes necessary and completely unavoidable if you want to do anything worthwhile, whether it&#8217;s building a company, paying your bills, or raising your kids. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve started to wonder about all the times when <em>hard work</em> was, well, unnecessary. Or at least inefficient. And I&#8217;ve started to believe that&#8217;s the case a lot more often than we think. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I once wrote an if-else statement that was like 25 lines of code. (this was during my first two months of bootcamp, mind you) and it took forever. All the typing, copy/pasting, and carefully organizing my data ended up delivering me the result I was hoping for (the app worked!) but it was horribly, embarrassingly, inefficient. I could have done the same thing with about 4 line of code instead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also love tracking the hours I spend working on coding as a measure of how productive I&#8217;m being, or how &#8220;hard&#8221; I&#8217;m working. But if I had written that if-statement the efficient way, those hours I was so proud of logging simply wouldn&#8217;t have been logged. Does that mean I would&#8217;ve been a less hard worker? Well, yes. But it also means, in that case, I would have been a better coder. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, my thought for now is, there&#8217;s an important caveat to hard work that I think we should talk about more. It&#8217;s that it doesn&#8217;t mean much if the work is being done inefficiently. <em>Work smart, not hard </em>sums it up nicely. I made that up, by the way.</p>\n","slug":"more-work-less-energy"}},{"node":{"id":"9c962a8f-dd28-55a8-88ab-3e11118183cc","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;m writing this as a sample blog post for my personal site.

Turns out I wasn&#8217;t today, but as I got deeper and deeper into the work <em>my head cleared itself. </em>Huh. Or I should say <em>the deeper the work, the clearer my head becomes. </em>That would be lovely because it would indicate that the way to find that clear-head isn&#8217;t so mysterious, and that a clear-head is not requisite, but rather a consequence, of doing challenging work. Which, so far, for me, this definitely is. </p>\n","slug":"development-is-complicated"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
