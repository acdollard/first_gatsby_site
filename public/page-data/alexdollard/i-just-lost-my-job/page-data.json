It happened yesterday in the early afternoon. I got a call from my boss who told me in a very honest and professional tone that he and his partner were having issues, that the business was going to need restructuring, and that he couldn&#8217;t justify keeping me on the payroll while there were fundamental questions about if and how the business would move forward. I told him I understand completely. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler, if you&#8217;re reading this, it&#8217;s been a real pleasure working with you dude. You made me the third team member of your business, which was and continues to be your baby; you made room for me when funding was slim and you didn&#8217;t have to. You know this, but I ain&#8217;t got nothing but love for Moximetrics. Thanks homie. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back to the general reader. That&#8217;s really it. It was only a part time job, but it was fun and I liked it. Alas I am now back on the job search. Kind of serendipitous that it happened in the middle of this 10-day portfolio challenge I&#8217;ve given myself though&#8230; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, I&#8217;m not tripping; I&#8217;m okay and I know I&#8217;ll be okay.  Just gotta get back to work, whatever that means. Right now it means finishing this motherfucking portfolio page ðŸ™‚</p>\n","slug":"i-just-lost-my-job"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
