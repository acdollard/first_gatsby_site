                    I'm a guy who has spent the last year or so learning to build websites. I built this website! I hope
                    you approve. I built it using React, Sass for styling, Wordpress as a headless CMS/database, and Gatsby
                    to statically render all my pages, so they should show up pretty sharpish. <br /><br />
                    I live in Nashville, TN. Besides web development, I also really like to play the piano and read interesting
                    books, fiction and nonfiction alike. Also I have a dog named Patch who has been described as 'annoyingly cute'
                    <br /><br/>
